# Religious Text Comparison Tool

With this tool, you can input one chapter of a religious text, and the app will return the most similar chapter
of another text that you select.

The tool runs on Flask; you can download the folder and run `python bible.py` in the terminal. However, you
will need to run my other code to create the pickled data files, and then add them to this folder locally.
